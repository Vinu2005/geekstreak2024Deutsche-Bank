Longest Prefix Suffix
Difficulty: HardAccuracy: 27.91%Submissions: 122K+Points: 8
Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.

NOTE: Prefix and suffix can be overlapping but they should not be equal to the entire string.

Examples :

Input: str = "abab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "ab" is the longest proper prefix and suffix. 
Input: str = "aaaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: "aaa" is the longest proper prefix and suffix. 
Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |str| ≤ 10^6
str contains lower case English alphabets

class Solution:
    def lps(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        lps = [0] * n  # Initialize the LPS array
        length = 0  # Length of the previous longest prefix suffix
        
        i = 1  # Start from the second character
        while i < n:
            if s[i] == s[length]:
                length += 1
                lps[i] = length
                i += 1
            else:
                if length != 0:
                    length = lps[length - 1]
                else:
                    lps[i] = 0
                    i += 1
        
        # The last value in the LPS array is the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix
        return lps[-1]
