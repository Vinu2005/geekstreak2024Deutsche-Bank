Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 24.83%Submissions: 485K+Points: 4
Given an unsorted array arr of of positive integers. One number 'A' from set {1, 2,....,n} is missing and one number 'B' occurs twice in array. Find numbers A and B.

Examples

Input: arr[] = [2, 2]
Output: 2 1
Explanation: Repeating number is 2 and smallest positive missing number is 1.
Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 3] 
Output: 3 2
Explanation: Repeating number is 3 and smallest positive missing number is 2.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ n

class Solution:
    def findTwoElement( self,arr):
        # Initialize variables for repeating and missing numbers
        repeating = -1
        missing = -1
        
        # Mark the array using indices
        for i in range(n):
            index = abs(arr[i]) - 1
            if arr[index] < 0:
                repeating = abs(arr[i])  # If already negative, it's the repeating number
            else:
                arr[index] = -arr[index]  # Mark as visited by negating the value
        
        # Find the missing number by checking for positive values
        for i in range(n):
            if arr[i] > 0:  # The index with a positive value is the missing number
                missing = i + 1
        
        return repeating, missing
