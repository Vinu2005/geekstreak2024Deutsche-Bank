Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 56.08%Submissions: 334K+Points: 2
Given a String str, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.

Note: The last character has not been '.'. 

Examples :

Input: str = i.like.this.program.very.much
Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
Explanation: After reversing the whole string(not individual words), the input string becomes much.very.program.this.like.i
Input: str = pqr.mno
Output: mno.pqr
Explanation: After reversing the whole string , the input string becomes mno.pqr
Expected Time Complexity: O(|str|)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(|str|)

Constraints:
1 <= |str| <= 10^5

class Solution:
    
    # Function to reverse words in a given string.
    def reverseWords(self, str):
        # Split the string by dots to get a list of words.
        words = str.split('.')
        
        # Reverse the list of words.
        words.reverse()
        
        # Join the reversed words with dots and return the result.
        return '.'.join(words)
